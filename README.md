# Admin Tests Automation Framework

This repository contains an automated testing framework for testing admin functionalities in [OrangeHRM](https://www.orangehrm.com/) using **Playwright**, **TestNG**, and **Allure** reporting. The framework automates critical user management features (e.g., adding and deleting users) using the Page Object Model (POM) for maintainable, scalable code.

## Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java**: JDK 11 or higher
- **Maven**: For dependency management
- **Node.js**: Required for Playwright installation
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- A compatible browser (Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit) installed for Playwright
- An OrangeHRM instance (e.g., [demo site](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/))

â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                               # Ignored files (e.g., screenshots, allure-results)
â””â”€â”€ README.md                                # This file
```

- Generated files like `screenshots/` and `allure-results/` are excluded from Git (see `.gitignore`) and uploaded as artifacts in GitHub Actions.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VertexXX6/OrangeHRM-Automation-Test-Suite-With-Playwright.git
   cd OrangeHRM-Automation-Test-Suite-With-Playwright
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure Maven is installed, then run:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```
   - Install Playwright browsers:
     ```bash
     mvn exec:java -e -Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -Dexec.args="install"
     ```

3. **Configure Test Settings**:
   - Create a `config.properties` file in `src/test/resources/` with the following content:
     ```properties
     baseUrl=https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/
     adminUser=admin
     adminPassword=admin123
     headless=true
     ```
   - **Security Note**: Do not commit `config.properties` with sensitive data. Use environment variables for `adminUser` and `adminPassword`:
     ```bash
     export ORANGEHRM_ADMIN_USER=admin
     export ORANGEHRM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
     ```

## Running Tests
The framework uses **TestNG** and a `BaseTest` class to centralize Playwright setup, teardown, and error handling (e.g., screenshots, videos for failed tests).

1. **Run All Tests**:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

2. **Run Specific Test Class**:
   To run only the `AdminTests` class:
   ```bash
   mvn test -Dtest=AdminTests
   ```

3. **Run in Headed Mode**:
   By default, tests run in headless mode. To run in headed mode (browser visible), update `config.properties` to set `headless=false`, or pass it as a system property:
   ```bash
   mvn test -Dheadless=false
   ```

4. **Test Output**:
   - Test logs are generated using SLF4J and can be viewed in the console.
   - Screenshots and videos for failed tests are saved in `screenshots/` and `videos/`, respectively, and attached to Allure reports.

## Test Cases
- **Add User**: Verifies that an admin can add a new user, checking the record count increases by 1.
- **Delete User**: Verifies that an admin can delete a user, ensuring the record count decreases by 1.

## GitHub Actions Integration
The repository is configured with a **GitHub Actions** workflow to automatically run tests on every push or pull request. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/maven.yml`.

### Key Features of the Workflow:
- Runs on `ubuntu-latest`.
- Sets up JDK 11 and Maven.
- Installs Playwright browsers.
- Executes tests using `mvn test`.
- Generates and uploads Allure reports and screenshots as artifacts.

To view the workflow status:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Check the latest workflow run for success/failure details.

## Accessing Test Artifacts
- **Screenshots**: Uploaded as artifacts for failed tests (see the "Artifacts" section in the Actions tab).
- **Allure Reports**: Generated and uploaded after each run, accessible in the Actions tab.

## Allure Reporting
The framework integrates **Allure** for detailed test reporting.

1. **Generate Allure Report**:
   After running tests, generate the report:
   ```bash
   mvn allure:report
   ```

2. **View Allure Report**:
   Open the generated report:
   ```bash
   mvn allure:serve
   ```
   This starts a local server and opens the report in your default browser. Reports include:
   - Test case descriptions and severity.
   - Screenshots and videos for failed tests.
   - Test execution logs.


## Troubleshooting
- **Playwright Browser Issues**:
  - Ensure browsers are installed (`mvn exec:java -e -Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -Dexec.args="install"`).
  - Verify Node.js is installed.
- **Configuration Errors**:
  - Check `config.properties` for correct `baseUrl`, `adminUser`, and `adminPassword`.
  - Ensure environment variables are set if used.
- **Test Failures**:
  - Review Allure reports for screenshots, videos, and logs.
  - Ensure the OrangeHRM instance is accessible at the specified `baseUrl`.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add your feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.

**Guidelines**:
- Follow the Page Object Model (POM) for new page classes.
- Add Allure annotations (`@Description`, `@Severity`) to test methods.
- Ensure tests are independent and clean up test data.
- Update `README.md` if new features are added.

## Future Improvements
- Add tests for additional OrangeHRM modules (e.g., leave management, employee profiles).
- Implement retry logic for flaky tests using TestNG's `IRetryAnalyzer`.
- Support multiple browsers (Firefox, WebKit) via `PlaywrightFactory`.
